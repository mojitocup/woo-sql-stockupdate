# woo-sql-stockupdate
update SQL database to make specific changes in WooCommerce

- set stock to Outofstock or instock within specific category if post havent been modified.
(if you use CSV importer for big amount of data - useful code to set SQL event, so all products that havent been updated goes out of stock automatically)
